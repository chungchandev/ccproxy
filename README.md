A lightweight, high-performance reverse proxy for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, built with Rust.

CCProxy sits in front of your Bedrock server and forwards player traffic while keeping server discovery data, query responses, and operational logging in sync. It is designed to be easy to deploy, simple to configure, and fast under load.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built with Rust and the Tokio async runtime for non-blocking I/O.
- **MOTD Forwarding**: Automatically syncs the server MOTD from the upstream Bedrock server every 5 seconds, with fallback support.
- **Query Protocol**: Full implementation of the Minecraft Query Protocol, proxied from the upstream server with automatic updates.
- **HAProxy v2 Protocol**: Optional PROXY protocol support to preserve the real client IP address on the upstream server.
- **BDS and GeyserMC Compatible**: Works with the official Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server and GeyserMC.
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML config file with environment variable overrides, prefixed with `CCPROXY__`.
- **Structured Logging**: Dual output (stdout plus rolling daily log files) with configurable log levels and JSON format support.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean shutdown handling with configurable timeout.
- **Single Binary**: Zero external dependencies, just one executable.

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name ccproxy \
  -p 19132:19132/udp \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/chungchandev/ccproxy:latest
```

### Pre-built Binary

1. Download the latest release from: https://github.com/chungchandev/ccproxy/releases/latest
2. Run `./ccproxy run`
3. A default config is auto-generated at `data/config/config.yaml`

## Configuration

On first run, CCProxy generates a default config file at `data/config/config.yaml`.

You can override any value with environment variables prefixed with `CCPROXY__`. For nested keys, use double underscores, for example `CCPROXY__PROXY__ADDRESS`.

```yaml
# Logging configuration
log:
  # Stdout logging
  stdout:
    filter: "info"        # Log level filter (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
    format: plain          # Log format: "plain" or "json"
  # File logging (daily rolling files in data/logs/)
  file:
    filter: "info"
    format: plain

# Proxy server configuration
proxy:
  address: "0.0.0.0:19132"   # Address the proxy listens on
  # Fallback MOTD shown when the upstream server is unreachable
  fallback_motd:
    edition: MCPE              # MCPE (Bedrock) or MCEE (Education Edition)
    server_name: "CCProxy"
    protocol_version: 827
    version: "1.21.101"
    num_players: 0
    max_players: 100
    server_sub_name: "CCProxy"
    gametype: Survival         # Survival or Creative
    nintendo_limited: false
    ipv4_port: 19132
    ipv6_port: null
  # Fallback Query Protocol response
  fallback_query:
    motd: "CCProxy"
    game_type: "SMP"
    map: "CCProxy"
    num_players: 0
    max_players: 100
    host_port: 19132
    host_ip: "0.0.0.0"
    version: "1.21.101"

# Upstream (backend) server configuration
upstream:
  address: "127.0.0.1:19133"           # Upstream Bedrock server address
  query_address: "127.0.0.1:19133"     # Upstream Query Protocol address (null to disable)
  proxy_protocol: false                  # Enable HAProxy v2 PROXY protocol
```

### Environment Variables

- All config values can be overridden with environment variables.
- Prefix: `CCPROXY__`
- Nesting uses double underscore: `__`
- Example: `CCPROXY__UPSTREAM__ADDRESS=192.168.1.100:19133`
- A `.env` file in the working directory is supported.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Target | Download |

## Building from Source

Prerequisites: Rust toolchain (edition 2024).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chungchandev/ccproxy.git
cd ccproxy
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/ccproxy`.

Nix flake support is also available:

```sh
nix build
# or run directly
nix run . -- run
```

## Architecture

- **Proxy Core**: Accepts RakNet connections and creates bidirectional tunnels (Client<->Server) for each session.
- **MOTD Updater**: Periodically pings the upstream server and updates the advertised MOTD.
- **Query Handler**: Implements the Minecraft Query Protocol with challenge token authentication, syncing stats from upstream.
- **Config Loader**: Merges YAML config with environment variable overrides using Figment.
